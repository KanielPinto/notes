### Vulnerability Analysis and Penetration Testing (VAPT)

A vulnerability assessment focuses on scanning hosts for vulnerabilities as individual entities so that security deficiencies can be **identified** and effective security measures can be deployed to **protect** the network in a prioritized manner. Most of the work can be done with automated tools and performed by operators without requiring much technical knowledge.

Penetration tests might start by scanning for vulnerabilities just as a regular vulnerability assessment but provide further information on how an attacker can chain vulnerabilities to achieve specific goals. While its focus remains on **identifying** vulnerabilities and establishing measures to **protect** the network, it also considers the network as a whole ecosystem and how an attacker could profit from interactions between its components.
#### **Key Responsibilities**:
- Perform vulnerability assessments and identify potential weaknesses.
- Conduct ethical hacking and penetration tests to simulate real-world cyberattacks.
- Report vulnerabilities with actionable steps to mitigate risks.
- Collaborate with development teams to ensure secure coding practices.

### Red Teaming

To keep up with the emerging threats, red team engagements were designed to shift the focus from regular penetration tests into a process that allows us to clearly see our defensive team's capabilities at **detecting** and **responding** to a real threat actor. They don't replace traditional penetration tests, but complement them by focusing on detection and response rather than prevention.

Red teams are tasked with mimicking the behavior of cybercriminals or nation-state actors to evaluate how well an organization's security defenses can withstand a full-blown cyberattack. Unlike penetration testing, which focuses on finding vulnerabilities, red teaming assesses an organization’s response to an actual attack scenario, including human error, physical security weaknesses, and more.

#### **Key Responsibilities**:
- Simulate advanced, multi-stage cyberattacks to test the resilience of security systems and protocols.
- Use techniques like social engineering, phishing, and network manipulation to gain unauthorized access.
- Work closely with blue teams (defenders) to improve response protocols.
- Provide insights into how adversaries could breach systems and exploit vulnerabilities.

### Blue Teaming

**Blue Teaming** focuses on defending an organization from cyberattacks and maintaining strong security measures. The blue team is responsible for identifying potential vulnerabilities, responding to security incidents, and continuously improving an organization's defense mechanisms. While red teams actively attempt to breach the system, blue teams work to detect, prevent, and mitigate these attacks.

Blue teams are typically tasked with real-time monitoring, incident response, and ensuring that security protocols are effectively implemented across an organization's infrastructure. They work to strengthen firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other preventive measures to thwart attacks.

#### 1. Security Analyst

A **Security Analyst** monitors and analyzes an organization's networks and systems to detect and respond to security threats and vulnerabilities.

#### 2. Security Engineer

A **Security Engineer** designs, implements, and manages secure systems, networks, and protocols to protect an organization’s IT infrastructure from cyber threats.

#### 3. Incident Responder

An **Incident Responder** handles and investigates security breaches or cyberattacks, working to contain, mitigate, and learn from the incident to prevent future attacks.

#### 4. Digital Forensics Examiner

A **Digital Forensics Examiner** recovers, analyzes, and preserves digital evidence from devices to investigate cybercrimes or security incidents.

#### 5. Malware Analyst

A **Malware Analyst** studies and dissects malicious software to understand its behavior, develop detection methods, and assist in mitigating future threats.

### Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC)

**Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** is a critical aspect of cybersecurity that focuses on aligning security practices with regulatory requirements, managing risk, and ensuring an organization is in compliance with relevant laws and industry standards. GRC professionals help organizations define their security policies, assess risks, and ensure adherence to various laws and frameworks like GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001.

The goal of GRC is to establish effective processes for managing risk, maintain proper governance over cybersecurity practices, and ensure that the organization’s activities comply with applicable laws, regulations, and standards.

#### **Key Responsibilities**:
- Develop and enforce security governance frameworks and policies.
- Assess and manage risks related to information security, privacy, and compliance.
- Monitor compliance with industry standards, regulations, and internal policies.
- Report on risk levels and propose mitigation strategies to senior management.

## **What is VAPT actually like ?**


### Initial Meeting and Walkthrough

Any VAPT project should ideally always begin with an initial meeting with both relevant level management team as well as the development team responsible for the project.
### Vulnerability Analysis

This is the simplest form of security assessment, and its main objective is to identify as many vulnerabilities in as many systems in the network as possible. To this end, concessions may be made to meet this goal effectively. For example, the attacker's machine may be allow-listed on the available security solutions to avoid interfering with the vulnerability discovery process. This makes sense since the objective is to look at every host on the network and evaluate its security posture individually while providing the most information to the company about where to focus its remediation efforts.
### Penetration Testing

On top of scanning every single host for vulnerabilities, we often need to understand how they impact our network as a whole. Penetration tests add to vulnerability assessments by allowing the pentester to explore the impact of an attacker on the overall network by doing additional steps that include:

- Attempt to **exploit** the vulnerabilities found on each system. This is important as sometimes a vulnerability might exist in a system, but compensatory controls in place effectively prevent its exploitation. It also allows us to test if we can use the detected vulnerabilities to compromise a given host.
- Conduct **post-exploitation** tasks on any compromised host, allowing us to find if we can extract any helpful information from them or if we might use them to pivot to other hosts that were not previously accessible from where we stand.
