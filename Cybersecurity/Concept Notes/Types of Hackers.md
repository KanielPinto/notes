| White Hat        | These hackers are considered the "good people". They remain within the law and use their skills to benefit others.                    | For example, a penetration tester performing an authorised engagement on a company.          |
| Grey Hat         | These people use their skills to benefit others often; however, they do not respect/follow the law or ethical standards at all times. | For example, someone taking down a scamming site.                                            |
| Black Hat        | These people are criminals and often seek to damage organisations or gain some form of financial benefit at the cost of others.       | For example, ransomware authors infect devices with malicious code and hold data for ransom. |
