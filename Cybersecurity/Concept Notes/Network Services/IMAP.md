POP3 is enough when working from one device, e.g., your favourite email client on your desktop computer. However, what if you want to check your email from your office desktop computer and from your laptop or smartphone? In this scenario, you need a protocol that allows synchronization of messages instead of deleting a message after retrieving it. One solution to maintaining a synchronized mailbox across multiple devices is Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP).

IMAP allows synchronizing read, moved, and deleted messages. IMAP is quite convenient when you check your email via multiple clients. Unlike POP3, which tends to minimize server storage as email is downloaded and deleted from the remote server, IMAP tends to use more storage as email is kept on the server and synchronized across the email clients.

The IMAP protocol commands are more complicated than the POP3 protocol commands. We list a few examples below:

- `LOGIN <username> <password>` authenticates the user
- `SELECT <mailbox>` selects the mailbox folder to work with
- `FETCH <mail_number> <data_item_name>` Example `fetch 3 body[]` to fetch message number 3, header and body.
- `MOVE <sequence_set> <mailbox>` moves the specified messages to another mailbox
- `COPY <sequence_set> <data_item_name>` copies the specified messages to another mailbox
- `LOGOUT` logs out
