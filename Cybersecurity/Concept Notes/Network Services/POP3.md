The Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) is designed to allow the client to communicate with a mail server and retrieve email messages.

Without going into in-depth technical details, an email client sends its messages by relying on SMTP and retrieves them using POP3. SMTP is similar to handing your envelope or package to the post office, and POP3 is similar to checking your local mailbox for new letters or packages.

Some common POP3 commands are:
- `USER <username>` identifies the user
- `PASS <password>` provides the userâ€™s password
- `STAT` requests the number of messages and total size
- `LIST` lists all messages and their sizes
- `RETR <message_number>` retrieves the specified message
- `DELE <message_number>` marks a message for deletion
- `QUIT` ends the POP3 session applying changes, such as deletions
