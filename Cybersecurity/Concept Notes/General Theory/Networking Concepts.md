### **IP Addresses**

Briefly, an IP address (or Internet Protocol) address can be used as a way of identifying a host on a network for a period of time, where that IP address can then be associated with another device without the IP address changing. An **IP** address is a set of numbers that are divided into four octets. The value of each octet will summarize to be the IP address of the device on the network. This number is calculated through a technique known as IP addressing & subnetting, but that is for another day. What's important to understand here is that IP addresses can change from device to device but cannot be active simultaneously more than once within the same network.

### **MAC Addresses**

Devices on a network will all have a physical network interface, which is a microchip board found on the device's motherboard. This network interface is assigned a unique address at the factory it was built at, called a **MAC** (Media Access Control ) address. The MAC address is a **twelve-character** hexadecimal number (_a base sixteen numbering system used in computing to represent numbers_) split into two's and separated by a colon. These colons are considered separators. For example, _a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d_. The first six characters represent the company that made the network interface, and the last six is a unique number.

However, an interesting thing with MAC addresses is that they can be faked or "spoofed" in a process known as spoofing.

### **ICMP**

Two popular commands rely on ICMP, and they are instrumental in network troubleshooting and network security. The commands are:

- `ping`: This command uses ICMP to test connectivity to a target system and measures the round-trip time (RTT). In other words, it can be used to learn that the target is alive and that its reply can reach our system.
- `traceroute`: This command is called `traceroute` on Linux and UNIX-like systems and `tracert` on MS Windows systems. It uses ICMP to discover the route from your host to the target.

Ping is one of the most fundamental network tools available to us. Ping uses **ICMP** (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to determine the performance of a connection between devices, for example, if the connection exists or is reliable.

Pings can be performed against devices on a network, such as your home network or resources like websites. This tool can be easily used and comes installed on Operating Systems (OSs) such as Linux and Windows.


## **OSI Model**

| Layer Number | Layer Name         | Main Function                                         | Example Protocols and Standards           |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Layer 7      | Application layer  | Providing services and interfaces to applications     | HTTP, FTP, DNS, POP3, SMTP, IMAP          |
| Layer 6      | Presentation layer | Data encoding, encryption, and compression            | Unicode, MIME, JPEG, PNG, MPEG            |
| Layer 5      | Session layer      | Establishing, maintaining, and synchronising sessions | NFS, RPC                                  |
| Layer 4      | Transport layer    | End-to-end communication and data segmentation        | UDP, TCP                                  |

### **P**lease **D**o **N**ot **T**hrow **S**ausage **P**izza **A**way.
### Layer 1 - Physical

The physical layer, also referred to as layer 1, deals with the physical connection between devices; this includes the medium, such as a wire, and the definition of the binary digits 0 and 1. Data transmission can be via an electrical, optical, or wireless signal. Consequently, we need data cables or antennas, depending on our physical medium.

### Layer 2 - Data Link

The data link layer focuses on the physical addressing of the transmission. It receives a packet from the network layer (including the IP address for the remote computer) and adds in the physical **MAC** (Media Access Control) address of the receiving endpoint. Inside every network-enabled computer is a **N**etwork **I**nterface Card (**NIC**) which comes with a unique MAC address to identify it.

### Layer 3 - Network

The network layer, i.e., layer 3, is concerned with sending data between different networks. In more technical terms, the network layer handles logical addressing and routing, i.e., finding a path to transfer the network packets between the diverse networks. Routing simply determines the most optimal path in which these chunks of data should be sent.

Whilst some protocols at this layer determine exactly what is the "optimal" path that data should take to reach a device, we should only know about their existence at this stage of the networking module. Briefly, these protocols include **OSPF** (**O**pen **S**hortest **P**ath **F**irst) and **RIP** (**R**outing **I**nformation **P**rotocol). At this layer, everything is dealt with via IP addresses such as 192.168.1.100.

### Layer 4 - Transport

Layer 4, the transport layer, enables end-to-end communication between running applications on different hosts.

Layer 4 of the OSI model plays a vital part in transmitting data across a network using TCP or UDP.

| **Advantages of TCP**                                                                    | **Disadvantages of TCP  <br>**                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Guarantees the accuracy of data.                                                         | Requires a reliable connection between the two devices. If one small chunk of data is not received, then the entire chunk of data cannot be used. |
| Capable of synchronising two devices to prevent each other from being flooded with data. | A slow connection can bottleneck another device as the connection will be reserved on the receiving computer the whole time.                      |
| Performs a lot more processes for reliability.                                           | TCP is significantly slower than UDP because more work has to be done by the devices using this protocol.                                         |

| **Advantages of UDP**                                                                                                 | **Disadvantages of UDP**                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| UDP is much faster than TCP.                                                                                          | UDP doesn't care if the data is received.                                          |
| UDP leaves the application layer (user software) to decide if there is any control over how quickly packets are sent. | It is quite flexible to software developers in this sense.                         |
| UDP does not reserve a continuous connection on a device as TCP does.                                                 | This means that unstable connections result in a terrible experience for the user. |

### Layer 5 - Session

The session layer is responsible for establishing, maintaining, and synchronising communication between applications running on different hosts. Establishing a session means initiating communication between applications and negotiating the necessary parameters for the session. Data synchronization ensures that data is transmitted in the correct order and provides mechanisms for recovery in case of transmission failures.

### Layer 6 - Presentation

Layer 6 of the OSI model is the layer in which standardization starts to take place. Because software developers can develop any software such as an email client differently, the data still needs to be handled in the same way — no matter how the software works. This layer acts as a translator for data to and from the application layer (layer 7).

### Layer 7 - Application

The application layer is the layer in which protocols and rules are in place to determine how the user should interact with data sent or received. Everyday applications provide a friendly, **G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface (**GUI**) for users to interact with data sent or received. Other protocols include **DNS** (**D**omain **N**ame **S**ystem), which is how website addresses are translated into IP addresses.

## **TCP/IP Model**

- **Application Layer**: The OSI model application, presentation and session layers, i.e., layers 5, 6, and 7, are grouped into the application layer in the TCP/IP model.
- **Transport Layer**: This is layer 4.
- **Internet Layer**: This is layer 3. The OSI model’s network layer is called the Internet layer in the TCP/IP model.
- **Link Layer**: This is layer 2.

The table below shows how the TCP/IP model layers map to the ISO/OSI model layers:

| Layer Number | ISO OSI Model      | TCP/IP Model (RFC 1122) | Protocols                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 7            | Application Layer  | Application Layer       | HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, POP3, SMTP, IMAP, Telnet, SSH, |
| 6            | Presentation Layer |                         |                                                  |
| 5            | Session Layer      |                         |                                                  |
| 4            | Transport Layer    | Transport Layer         | TCP, UDP                                         |
| 3            | Network Layer      | Internet Layer          | IP, ICMP, IPSec                                  |
| 2            | Data Link Layer    | Link Layer              | Ethernet 802.3, WiFi 802.11                      |
| 1            | Physical Layer     |                         |                                                  |
## **Packets**

Packets and frames are small pieces of data that, when forming together, make a larger piece of information or message. Think of this as putting an envelope within an envelope and sending it away. The first envelope will be the packet that you mail, but once it is opened, the envelope within still exists and contains data (this is a frame).

### IP Packet
| **Header**          | **Description**                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Time to Live        | This field sets an expiry timer for the packet to not clog up your network if it never manages to reach a host or escape!                                               |
| Checksum            | This field provides integrity checking for protocols such as TCP/IP. If any data is changed, this value will be different from what was expected and therefore corrupt. |
| Source Address      | The IP address of the device that the packet is being sent **from** so that data knows where to **return to**.                                                          |
| Destination Address | The device's IP address the packet is being sent to so that data knows where to travel next.                                                                            |

### TCP/IP Packet

| Header                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Source Port            | This value is the port opened by the sender to send the TCP packet from. This value is chosen randomly (out of the ports from 0-65535 that aren't already in use at the time).                                                                      |
| Destination Port       | This value is the port number that an application or service is running on the remote host (the one receiving data); for example, a webserver running on port 80. Unlike the source port, this value is not chosen at random.                       |
| Source IP              | This is the IP address of the device that is sending the packet.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Destination IP         | This is the IP address of the device that the packet is destined for.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Sequence Number        | When a connection occurs, the first piece of data transmitted is given a random number.                                                                                                                                                             |
| Acknowledgement Number | After a piece of data has been given a sequence number, the number for the next piece of data will have the sequence number + 1. We'll also explain this more in-depth further on.                                                                  |
| Checksum               | This value is what gives TCP integrity. A mathematical calculation is made where the output is remembered. When the receiving device performs the mathematical calculation, the data must be corrupt if the output is different from what was sent. |
| Data                   | This header is where the data, i.e. bytes of a file that is being transmitted, is stored.                                                                                                                                                           |
| Flag                   | This header determines how the packet should be handled by either device during the handshake process. Specific flags will determine specific behaviours, which is what we'll come on to explain below.                                             |

| **Step** | **Message** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | SYN         | A SYN message is the initial packet sent by a client during the handshake. This packet is used to initiate a connection and synchronise the two devices together (we'll explain this further later on).                                            |
| 2        | SYN/ACK     | This packet is sent by the receiving device (server) to acknowledge the synchronisation attempt from the client.                                                                                                                                   |
| 3        | ACK         | The acknowledgement packet can be used by either the client or server to acknowledge that a series of messages/packets have been successfully received.                                                                                            |
| 4        | DATA        | Once a connection has been established, data (such as bytes of a file) is sent via the "DATA" message.                                                                                                                                             |
| 5        | FIN         | This packet is used to _cleanly (properly)_ close the connection after it has been complete.                                                                                                                                                       |
| #        | RST         | This packet abruptly ends all communication. This is the last resort and indicates there was some problem during the process. For example, if the service or application is not working correctly, or the system has faults such as low resources. |

### UDP Packet

| **Header**          | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Time to Live (TTL)  | This field sets an expiry timer for the packet, so it doesn't clog up your network if it never manages to reach a host or escape!                                                                                                 |
| Source Address      | The IP address of the device that the packet is being sent from, so that data knows where to return to.                                                                                                                           |
| Destination Address | The device's IP address the packet is being sent to so that data knows where to travel next.                                                                                                                                      |
| Source Port         | This value is the port that is opened by the sender to send the UDP packet from. This value is randomly chosen (out of the ports from 0-65535 that aren't already in use at the time).                                            |
| Destination Port    | This value is the port number that an application or service is running on the remote host (the one receiving the data); for example, a webserver running on port 80. Unlike the source port, this value is not chosen at random. |

| **F**ile **T**ransfer **P**rotocol (**FTP**)                       | 21              | This protocol is used by a file-sharing application built on a client-server model, meaning you can download files from a central location.                |
| **S**ecure **Sh**ell (**SSH**)                                     | 22              | This protocol is used to securely login to systems via a text-based interface for management.                                                              |
| **H**yper**T**ext Transfer Protocol (**HTTP**)                     | 80              | This protocol powers the World Wide Web (WWW)! Your browser uses this to download text, images and videos of web pages.                                    |

## **Firewalls**

A firewall is a device within a network responsible for determining what traffic is allowed to enter and exit. Think of a firewall as border security for a network. An administrator can configure a firewall to **permit** or **deny** traffic from entering or exiting a network based on numerous factors such as:
- Where the traffic is coming from? (has the firewall been told to accept/deny traffic from a specific network?)
- Where is the traffic going to? (has the firewall been told to accept/deny traffic destined for a specific network?)
- What port is the traffic for? (has the firewall been told to accept/deny traffic destined for port 80 only?)
- What protocol is the traffic using? (has the firewall been told to accept/deny traffic that is UDP, TCP or both?)

| **Firewall Category** |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

|       Stateless       | This firewall type uses a static set of rules to determine whether or not **individual packets** are acceptable or not. For example, a device sending a bad packet will not necessarily mean that the entire device is then blocked.<br><br>Whilst these firewalls use much fewer resources than alternatives, they are much dumber. For example, these firewalls are only effective as the rules that are defined within them. If a rule is not exactly matched, it is effectively useless.<br><br>However, these firewalls are great when receiving large amounts of traffic from a set of hosts (such as a Distributed Denial-of-Service attack) |

## **Virtual Private Network**

A **V**irtual **P**rivate **N**etwork (or **VPN** for short) is a technology that allows devices on separate networks to communicate securely by creating a dedicated path between each other over the Internet (known as a tunnel). Devices connected within this tunnel form their own private network.

| Allows networks in different geographical locations to be connected. | For example, a business with multiple offices will find VPNs beneficial, as it means that resources like servers/infrastructure can be accessed from another office.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Offers privacy.                                                      | VPN technology uses encryption to protect data. This means that it can only be understood between the devices it was being sent from and is destined for, meaning the data isn't vulnerable to sniffing.<br><br>This encryption is useful in places with public WiFi, where no encryption is provided by the network. You can use a VPN to protect your traffic from being viewed by other people.                                                                            |
| Offers anonymity.                                                    | Journalists and activists depend upon VPNs to safely report on global issues in countries where freedom of speech is controlled.<br><br>Usually, your traffic can be viewed by your ISP and other intermediaries and, therefore, tracked. <br><br>The level of anonymity a VPN provides is only as much as how other devices on the network respect privacy. For example, a VPN that logs all of your data/history is essentially the same as not using a VPN in this regard. |


## **DHCP**

Having an automated way to configure connected devices has many advantages. First, it would save us from manually configuring the network; this is extremely important, especially for mobile devices. Secondly, it saves us from address conflicts, i.e., when two devices are configured with the same IP address. An IP address conflict would prevent the involved hosts from using the network resources; this applies to local resources and the Internet. The solution lies in using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). DHCP is an application-level protocol that relies on UDP; the server listens on UDP port 67, and the client sends from UDP port 68. Your smartphone and laptop are configured to use DHCP by default.

DHCP follows four steps: Discover, Offer, Request, and Acknowledge (DORA):

1. **DHCP Discover**: The client broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER message seeking the local DHCP server if one exists.
2. **DHCP Offer**: The server responds with a DHCPOFFER message with an IP address available for the client to accept.
3. **DHCP Request**: The client responds with a DHCPREQUEST message to indicate that it has accepted the offered IP.
4. **DHCP Acknowledge**: The server responds with a DHCPACK message to confirm that the offered IP address is now assigned to this client.

In the DHCP packet exchange, we can notice the following:
- The client starts without any IP network configuration. It only has a MAC address. In the first and third packets, DHCP Discover and DHCP Request, the client searching for a DHCP server still has no IP network configuration and has not yet used the DHCP server’s offered IP address. Therefore, it sends packets from the IP address `0.0.0.0` to the broadcast IP address `255.255.255.255`.
- As for the link layer, in the first and third packets, the client sends to the broadcast MAC address, `ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff` (not shown in the output above). The DHCP server offers an available IP address along with the network configuration in the DHCP offer. It uses the client’s destination MAC address. (It used the proposed IP address in this example system.)

## **Routing**

The following are some important routing protocols:

- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**: OSPF is a routing protocol that allows routers to share information about the network topology and calculate the most efficient paths for data transmission. It does this by having routers exchange updates about the state of their connected links and networks. This way, each router has a complete map of the network and can determine the best routes to reach any destination.
- **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)**: EIGRP is a Cisco proprietary routing protocol that combines aspects of different routing algorithms. It allows routers to share information about the networks they can reach and the cost (like bandwidth or delay) associated with those routes. Routers then use this information to choose the most efficient paths for data transmission.
- **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**: BGP is the primary routing protocol used on the Internet. It allows different networks (like those of Internet Service Providers) to exchange routing information and establish paths for data to travel between these networks. BGP helps ensure data can be routed efficiently across the Internet, even when traversing multiple networks.
- **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**: RIP is a simple routing protocol often used in small networks. Routers running RIP share information about the networks they can reach and the number of hops (routers) required to get there. As a result, each router builds a routing table based on this information, choosing the routes with the fewest hops to reach each destination.


## **DNS**

DNS operates at the Application Layer, i.e., Layer 7 of the ISO OSI model. DNS traffic uses UDP port 53 by default and TCP port 53 as a default fallback. There are many types of DNS records; however, in this task, we will focus on the following four:

- **A record**: The A (Address) record maps a hostname to one or more IPv4 addresses. For example, you can set `example.com` to resolve to `172.17.2.172`.
- **AAAA Record**: The AAAA record is similar to the A Record, but it is for IPv6. Remember that it is AAAA (quad-A), as AA and AAA would refer to a battery size; furthermore, AAA refers to _Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting_; neither falls under DNS.
- **CNAME Record**: The CNAME (Canonical Name) record maps a domain name to another domain name. For example, `www.example.com` can be mapped to `example.com` or even to `example.org`.
- **MX Record**: The MX (Mail Exchange) record specifies the mail server responsible for handling emails for a domain.
