Spawn `/bin/bash` using [Pythonâ€™s PTY module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pty.html), and connect the controlling shell with its standard I/O.

### Fully Interactive TTY [#](https://0xffsec.com/handbook/shells/full-tty/#fully-interactive-tty)

Background the current remote shell (`^Z`), update the **local** terminal line settings with `stty`[2](https://0xffsec.com/handbook/shells/full-tty/#fn:2) and bring the remote shell back.

```sh
stty raw -echo && fg
```

After bringing the job back the cursor will be pushed to the left. Reinitialize the terminal with `reset`.
